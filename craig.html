                <p>
                    He was born in Hawaii, to a father from Kenya. His father returned there soon after his birth,
                    eventually having more children. Several years later, his mother remarried and they moved to
                    Indonesia.

                <p>
                    Barack was sent back to Hawaii for safety and education reasons, and primarily grew up there with
                    his grandparents. The absence of his father (and frequently of his mother) gave him a level of
                    independence, while his multicultural background gave him a unique perspective on society.

                    with his family while campaigning and serving in the legislature, but Michelle understood his
                    motivation and supported him. He enacted numerous reform laws.
