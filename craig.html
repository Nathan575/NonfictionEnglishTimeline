                <h3>Birth (1962)</h3>
                <p>
                    He was born in the South Side of Chicago to a mixed-race lower-middle class community experiencing “white flight”. This meant that over time, white communities began migrating out of his neighborhood and into racially homogenous suburbs, ultimately leading to deterioration of his area and of the public spaces in there. This also meant that he grew up with the first-hand effects of structural racism. He had a younger sister Michelle. Most of his extended family lived nearby, under similar economic and social situations. His maternal grandfather could also directly trace his ancestry to slaves, giving him a personal connection to such topics.

                <h3>Graduated from Mount Carmel High School (1979)</h3>
                <p>
                    His parents tried to give him a stronger education by sending him to an all-boys Catholic school, rather than to the deteriorating neighborhood schools. This became a theme in his upbringing: his parents wished him to get the best education he could regardless of the money they would have to spend to accomplish it. He ended up as valedictorian.

                <p>
                    He went to Princeton because his parents encouraged him to prioritize his education over their finances. While there, he was a basketball star and majored in sociology. He wrote his senior thesis about social stratification in prisons, but never continued pursuing social work. He began playing basketball professionally.

                    After basketball, he resumed his education by getting a degree in business. He began working on Wall Street, earning a massive income and living with luxuries such as fancy cars.

                <p>
                    Like <a href="michelle.html" style="color:rgba(106, 13, 173, 0.9);">Michelle</a>, he realized that his job brought him wealth but not happiness. This realization was spurred by a divorce he was going through at the time, as well as the previous loss of their father, which reminded him that life was short and had to be meaningful. He became a basketball coach.
