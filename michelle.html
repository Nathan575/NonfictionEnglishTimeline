                <h3>Birth (January 17, 1964)</h3>
                <p>
                    She was born in the South Side of Chicago to a mixed-race lower-middle class community experiencing “white flight”. This meant that over time, white communities began migrating out of her neighborhood and into racially homogenous suburbs, ultimately leading to deterioration of her area and of the public spaces in there. This also meant that she grew up with the first-hand effects of structural racism. She had an older brother Craig. Most of her extended family lived nearby, under similar economic and social situations. Her maternal grandfather could also directly trace his ancestry to slaves, giving her a personal connection to such topics.

                <p>
                    As the first magnet school in Chicago, Whitney Young gave her an opportunity to get a better education than she could in the underfunded schools in her neighborhood, such as her middle school. Though the school had racial quotas, when she went it was predominantly black students, continuing to limit her experiences to interactions with peers in similar situations as herself.

                <h3>Graduated From Princeton (1985)</h3>
                <p>
                    Following her <a href="craig.html" style="color:rgb(198, 31, 96);">brother</a>, she went to Princeton University. She was encouraged to reach for an Ivy League school by her parents, who hoped that she could obtain a strong education and be more successful than they ever were. This is in contrast to her grandparents, who had been forced to give up on their dreams. While there, she grappled with the difficulty of being placed in a mostly-white, privileged community for the first time, and feeling like an outsider. She joined several groups to support minorities at the university, and began to consider the issue more closely. She majored in sociology.

                <h3>Graduated From Harvard Law, Begin Working At Sidley Austin (1988)</h3>
                <p>
                    Her goal in college was simply to become educated and obtain a lucrative job. Thus, once she finished obtaining a Harvard education, she began working at the high-end law firm Sidley Austin. Once more in an almost entirely white environment, she ended up focusing on improving the company's hiring of minorities, such as by helping recruit law students.

                <p>
                    She met Barack Obama when he became a summer associate at her law office. She was put in charge of mentoring him, and they quickly began bonding over their personalities and opinions on social issues. They both cared deeply about supporting minorities in empowering themselves to rise above their social and economic restraints.

                <p>
                    Her father was always a massive influence on her life, in a large part due to his unstoppable determination. Despite being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis and becoming disabled, he still went to work every day to support his children's futures. His death was accelerated or even caused due to his willingness to suppress his pain and continue on without troubling others. This tragedy helped inspire Michelle to do something meaningful with her career. She soon left her job at the law firm and began working for the Chicago government and various nonprofits.

                <h3>Married Barack Obama (1992)</h3>
                <p>
                    Barack had a looser perspective on marriage than her, beliving that their love was good enough. She had a more traditionalist idea of marriage as a complete union between two people that was heavily inspired by her parents, who sacrificed their personal lives entirely for family. Ultimately, they settled on a marriage where they would each be free to pursue their own passions and causes.

                <h3>Barack Is Elected To The Illinois Senate (1996)</h3>
                <p>
                    This is when Barack began involving himself in politics. Michelle had a distaste for politics due to the way politicians rarely ended up helping communities like the one she grew up in. She also was not happy about Barack spending more time away from his family, but understood their mutual need to improve the world in the way they felt was most potent. Thus, she always supported Barack, even if dubiously.

                <h3>They Become the First Family of the U.S. (2008)</h3>
                <p>
                    Barack became the first Black president, a major milestone in their mission to empower underpriveledged groups, and his campaign promises included ending the war in Iraq, reforming healthcare, and supporting minorities. Michelle's position as First Lady also gave her immense power to execute social programs at the highest level. She created programs to combat childhood obesity, pursue education for young girls, and supporting military families. Many of these causes were spurred by her own personal connections to the issues, and she was effective due to her prior experience running nonprofits.

                <p>
                    Donald Trump represented a stark contrast to the Obamas. He grew up in a fairly wealthy family with access to his father's lucrative business. He had conservative politics that were far less in favor of social reform than the Obamas' were. In addition, Michelle was set completely against him when his boasts of sexually assaulting women were uncovered, and she gave a powerful speech calling him out.
