                <p>
                    He was born in Hawaii to a mother there and a father from Kenya. His father returned to Africa soon after his birth, eventually having more children. Several years later, his mother remarried and they moved to Indonesia. This situation meant that he ended up with siblings and relatives spread across several continents and cultures.

                <p>
                    Barack was sent back to Hawaii for safety and education reasons, and primarily grew up there with his grandparents. The absence of his father (and frequently of his mother) gave him a level of independence and self-motivaiton. His multicultural background gave him a unique perspective on society, as well as an array of family members he could turn to for their support and opinions.

                    He was one of a relatively few number of black students in a fairly prestigious school, and he began to awaken to the realities of racism and inequality. This was the period he described himself as truly beginning to notice the effects of race on society, and question how his multiracial genealogy fits into the world around him.

He began this by working in the South Side of Chicago, helping communities push for change from the government. His varied background gave him the ability to connect with people and understand their needs, and his education gave him the ability to actually turn that need into change.

                    Michelle had a more traditionalist idea of marriage as a complete union between two people. He, however, had a looser definition, believing that their love was enough. This was influenced by his loose family, with an absent father and a long-distance mother.

                    This is when Barack began involving himself in politics. This meant that he spent very little time with his family while campaigning and serving in the legislature, but Michelle understood his motivation and supported him. He did this because he sought a much larger platform to create change. Indeed, he enacted numerous reform laws.

                    Once more seeking a larger platform, he became the first Black president of the U.S. His campaign promises included ending the war in Iraq, reforming healthcare, and supporting minorities. This message resonated with the public, and his prior experience with community organizing and his prestigious degree gave him the necessary qualifications to make change.

                    The revolutionary healthcare system dubbed “Obamacare” made it significantly easier for low-income families to acquire healthcare, and was funded by raised taxes on wealthy families. It was extremely divisive, but was a symbol of what he hoped to accomplish. It also proved that he could make change.

                <p>
                    Donald Trump represented a stark contrast to the Obamas. He grew up in a fairly wealthy family with access to his father's lucrative business. He had conservative politics that were far less in favor of social reform than the Obamas' were. Trump also made false claims that Barack was Muslim or born in Africa in an attempt to use racism against him. Trump also did not disavow White supremacists, standing against everything the Obamas were for.
