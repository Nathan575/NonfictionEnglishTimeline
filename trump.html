                <p>
                    Trump’s first large project involved a massive renovation project that first attracted public attention. To do so, he took a large tax abatement, but while he ascribes this to his own skill, it was actually largely orchestrated by his father.

                <p>
                    This semi-biography (that wasn’t actually written by Trump) was a major starting point for Trump’s rise to popularity. In it, his life and accomplishments are described with flattery, cementing his reputation as charming and business-savvy and making him name-famous. However, a lot of the book is exaggerated or false, as he was not a very successful businessman.

                <h3>Donald Trump Elected President of the U.S. (2016)</h3>
                <p>
                    After a contentious election, Trump was elected president. This came as a surprise to many, as he had no former political experience, and was a poor businessman (though many people thought otherwise, for example because of <i>Art of the Deal</i>). He pushed right-wing politics, advocating relatively isolationist policies that restricted immigration and exited major international agreements like the Paris Agreement. He also undid Barack Obama’s “Obamacare” healthcare program. His slogan was to “make America great again”, suggesting that the country had fallen from former glory, as opposed to the Obamas' perspective that the country had to overcome ongoing issues rooted in the past.
